There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  Inventory Flow-control

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  Ensuring product gets where it's sent.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
  Inventory Flow-control builds checks-and-balances into your warehouse's inter-warehouse product management.  It coerces a count and confirmation whenever stock is transferred between departments, and live updates these counts online.  Management no longer needs to wait until day's end to see the inventory-count, or the day's progress.  Lost inventory and uncertain counts will be a thing of the past if Inventory Flow-control is properly integrated into your warehouse's work-flow.


## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  Inventory Flow-control eliminates eliminates the need to wait until day's end to see production counts and inventory levels.  It builds extra safeties into inventory flow and miscounts.  It will help you keep track of inventory and location within your warehouse.  Gone are the days of lost inventory or uncertain counts.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  By requiring a product count of what is being sent, and a confirmation count at receipt by two different people, it ensures that inventory is well tracked (or at least within an acceptable error margin).  Live updating this numbers means that managment is never in the dark, and product will not vanish.  It also eliminates the need for paper inventory-tracking, and lengthy and error-ridden data-entry.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
  "A revolutionary new take on warehouse inventory management"

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  Inventory Flow-control is a simple web-app that only requires a web-connection and an accurate initial product count.  Beyond that it'll control itself (provided that the two-factor count-confirmation has competent people on both ends.  Mind your units!)

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  "Ever since we started using Inventory Flow-Control we haven't had to stop the assembly line for insuffcient product counts.  We've seen the error far in advance!"
